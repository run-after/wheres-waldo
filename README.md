In this game, you enter your name on initial pop-up and click 'start'.

After you click start, the timer begins and you have to find all 4 characters in the picture.

After clicking on image, a targeting window and pop-up menu will appear, allowing you to make a guess of which character is within the targeting window.

If the correct character is selected, the image of selected character will fade, and that character will be removed from pop-up menu.

Once all characters are found, the timer stops, the score is calculated from figures from the DB, and the entered name will be posted on the scoreboard if you are in the top 10.
